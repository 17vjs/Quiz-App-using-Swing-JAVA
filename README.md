# Quiz-App-using-Swing-JAVA
We have developed a desktop application to take quizzes on any topic. 
The application starts with a login form to enter into the quiz.
Once entered, the quiz starts in full screen mode with a timer. 
Participant selects an answer and clicks the next button. Once answered , he canâ€™t navigate back to the previous question.
User has to answer all the questions within time. Either the user has answered all questions or the  timer is over, the result screen shows the analysis of performance.
User clicks the exit button to come out of full screen mode. This application is useful in conducting online tests from remote places.
The quiz can be given at your own convenience at any time and place.
The full screen mode makes it impossible for the  participant to switch to other apps.
